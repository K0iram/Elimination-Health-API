Elimination Health is a web app that logs meals and documents the date, description and how you felt after the meal. For that i built a single resource called meals that a given user can interact with.

The ERD for this relationship looks like this:

USERS -------< MEALS

In order to build this database I used Ruby to make: models, controllers, migrations, example data, and curl scripts. After testing all scripts in the console I deployed to a Heroku account that I have made. With my backend deployed to the internet I started work on my front end.
